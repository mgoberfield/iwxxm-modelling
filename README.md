# IWXXM Modelling

IWXXM (the ICAO Meteorological Information Exchange Model) is a data format for reporting aviation weather information  
in XML/GML and is specified in both XML Schema and Schematron. The model is designed using the Unified Modelling Language (UML) with Sparx Enterprise Architect (EA) and transformed into a GML Application Schema through a generator in EA.

This repository contains resources for modeling IWXXM, transforming it into XML/GML schemas, and collating Schematron rules defined in the model. It also allows the development of extensions to IWXXM features to further enhance its capability to exchange weather and related information.
