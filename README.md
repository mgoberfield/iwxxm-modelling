# IWXXM Modelling
IWXXM (the ICAO Meteorological Information Exchange Model) is a data format for reporting aviation weather information
in XML/GML, and is specified in both XML Schema and Schematron.  The model is designed using the Unified Modelling Language (UML) with Sparx Enterprise Architect (EA) and transformed into a GML Application Schema through a generator in EA.

This repository contains resources for modelling of IWXXM, transforming it into XML/GML schemas and collating schematron rules defined in the model.  It also allows development of extensions to IWXXM features to further enhance its capability to exchange weather and related information.
